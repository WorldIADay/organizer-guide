# Recruit a Team
World IA Day celebrations are most successful when there is a team of committed volunteers to share planning responsibilities. This document offers ideas to help you recruit your team and breaks down these responsibilities into roles that help make the celebration planning more manageable.

## Call for Volunteers
Social media is always a good way to recruit volunteers for your leadership team. We will make every effort to retweet, like, and share your call with our followers. Just be sure to tag @worldiaday or let us know. We are happy to help!

Many of our communities have local IA or UX meetups and gatherings. Don’t be shy. Reach out to the organizers of these events and see if they will help you get the word out. Often times they are community-minded people who are happy to help. Building relationships with these organizers can also help down the road when it is time to start marketing your celebration to the community. If they are willing to help, be sure to return the favor by promoting their events whenever possible.

If you do not have any local IA or UX meetups in your area, reach out to web development, business analyst, entrepreneur, and project management groups too. These professionals can benefit from attending a Word IA Day celebration!
