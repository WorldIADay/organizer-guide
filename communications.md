# Accessing Email, Twitter, and Slack

## Official Email Address
Each World IA Day location has a unique email address which can be used when communicating with sponsors, presenters and attendees. We understand you may not want to check another inbox so we set up forwarding so any incoming mail will go to the email address(s) listed on your application.

If you would like to check the inbox or send emails from your inbox, you can access it via http://webmail.worldiaday.org/src/login.php

In most cases, email addresses are formatted as: locationname@worldiaday.org.

Passwords are randomly generated and sent to you in your Welcome email.

For locations that may have the same name we will add a state, province or country indicator in your email address. In this case, we will reach out to you separately to disclose this information.

*Examples include:*
- sanjose.cr@worldiaday.org would be used for San Jose, Costa Rica
- sanjose.us@worldiaday.org would be used for San Jose, California, USA
- bristol@worldiaday.org  would be used for Bristol, England (first location in use)
- bristol.qc.ca@worldiaday.org would be used for Bristol, Quebec, Canada
- bristol.ga.us@worldiaday.org would be used for Bristol, Georgia, USA

The email service we use only allows administrators to change passwords or forwarding options. If you would like to change your password or add additional email addresses to the forwarding list, contact us at producer@worldiaday.org and we will be happy to modify this information for you.

## Twitter Accounts
We set up Twitter accounts for new World IA Day locations.

To access your account, use your official email address and password (password sent in Welcome email).

Note: For locations who already have Twitter accounts, we will not ask you to change your handle.

## Our Slack Channel
