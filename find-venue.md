# Find an Accessible Venue

By now you should know the size of the celebration you want to plan. Be realistic with your estimate of attendees and remember that a packed small room is better than an empty large one. Some of our past celebrations have been held at educational institutions, conference rooms within corporate office buildings and in coffee shops or pubs. All were equally amazing.

There are many factors to consider when choosing a venue for your celebration. It is important to always keep in mind the overall vision for your celebration as well as the number of attendees you expect.

Below are some factors that may or may not weigh into your decision, depending on your culture, location, and the size of your celebration.

## Venue Size & Cost
The size of your venue really depends on what you think makes the most sense for your location and what kind of celebration you envision. Consider attendance at gatherings similar to World IA Day in your location (i.e. meetups, professional gatherings) and the amount of attendees you are comfortable managing. It is also worth considering what venues are more readily available.

Renting a venue is often the one of the highest expense reported for a World IA Day celebration. Look into free venues, such as libraries or other community spaces, to eliminate this expense.


> TIP: In some cases, companies who are targets for sponsorship may be able to donate space instead of making a financial contribution. Reach out to these companies to see if they would donate their space in exchange for sponsorship perks.

## Audio & Visual Capabilities
Determine what audio / visual needs you might have and whether the venue has a built-in system you can leverage or if you will need to rent and setup your own equipment.

### Built-In Systems

Audio and visual configuration and recording setup is often done in collaboration with the venue. It is likely the venue will have a dedicated person on staff to assist with setup, testing and day-of support. Be sure to include this support when negotiating use of the venue.

### Renting Equipment
If you need to rent and setup your own equipment, it would be wise to plan for a rehearsal before the celebration to ensure everything is working as expected. If you intend to do this the day before your celebration, you may want to ask whether you can safely leave the equipment in place overnight or if there is a safe place to store it on-site for easy retrieval the day of your celebration.

### Hiring a Vendor
If you plan to hire someone to film or stream your celebration. You may want to schedule a walk-through of the venue so that the vendor can become familiar with how the day will flow, determine the equipment available and what they may need to bring.

Based on the size of your celebration, the equipment needed will vary. Below is a basic list denoting what is needed for a celebration that is recorded and/or streamed:

**BASIC A/V EQUIPMENT**
- Computers (Laptops)
- Sound Equipment
  - audio speakers
  - amplifier
  - microphones
  - mixer / soundboard
- Cords (HDMI)
- Streaming
  - audio / video encoder
  - streaming service: Livestream, Ustream, etc.)
- Projector & Screen (donâ€™t forget the remote and batteries!)
- Storage for recording

> TIP: For more information, review our [A/V Setup Guide](audio-video-setup-guide.md).

## Venue Accessibility / Ease of Access
Ease of access is important to consider on many levels. You want to be sure everyone can attend your event. Consider whether your attendees, volunteers and presenters are likely to be driving or using public transportation to get to the venue. In larger metropolitan areas or in a community made up of several cities, try to choose a location that is central to the majority of people.

Depending on the length of your event, it is important to consider access to food and beverage throughout the day. Celebrations often provide a lunch break of an hour or more so people can eat, have time to talk, and meet new people. Ensure the venue has space for people to comfortably eat lunch and carry on conversation.

Additionally, some location organizers cover the cost of lunch for their attendees and others do not. If you do not plan to pay for lunch, consider the following when selecting a venue:

- Ensure there is access to restaurants within a 5 minute walking distance of the celebration. You may want to speak with local restaurants to see if they would consider providing a coupon as an incentive to your attendees.
- Consider bringing food trucks on-site ensuring there is enough space for attendees to easily access them.

> TIP: If you do not plan to cover the cost of lunch for attendees, it is customary in most situations to cover the cost of lunch for volunteers, presenters and sometimes sponsors.

## Inclusive to All
To hold a celebration that anyone can attend, it is important to select a venue that is accessible. Below, Whitney Quesenbery, Director of Accessibility for World IA Day [2015 & 2016] shares some advice and resources to help ensure your event is inclusive to all.

### How will people get to the celebration?

Think about whether a venue will have enough parking and whether it will impose an additional cost to your attendees, volunteers and presenters. Be sure to also consider public transportation too, because people with disabilities may not drive. Being aware of construction projects that may impact the use of sidewalks, public transportation, or roads is another important factor to consider.

### How will people get into the building?

Look to see whether a person using a wheelchair can easily navigate to the entrance and enter the building. If the main entrance is not accessible, make sure there are clear signs posted, or at least space to post your own, to help provide directional guidance to the building entrance for your attendees, volunteers and presenters.

### How will people find your gathering space?

Check the path from the entrance to the gathering spaces used for your celebration. Look for good directional signs, ideally with Braille labels, that clearly mark pathways to gathering areas, elevators and stairs and bathrooms. If you determine the venue is ideal but the signage is not, plan to create your own directional signs and place volunteers at crossroads to help direct people.

### Are there facilities for people with disabilities?
Check the restrooms near the areas of the venue that will be used and make sure they are accessible. If they are on a different floor or a long way away, check for directional guidance, as you did with the building entrance, and plan for signage or volunteers to direct people.

### Other Useful Resources:
The National Federation of the Blind has [directions that include great instructions for someone coming to a new place for the first time](https://nfb.org/directions-nfb). The details are tailored for the blind, but are helpful for everyone. It is a good model for your crafting directions, covering driving, cabs, and public transportation.

The ACM SIG-ACCESS [Accessible Conference Guide](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/) covers all aspects of event planning, based on their experience running an annual conference for about 130 people that is attended by people with disabilities. In a typical year, there might be attendees who are blind, have low vision, are deaf or hard of hearing, use a power wheelchair or an electric scooter, have limited dexterity, and limited mobility. ASSETS strives to create an environment in which all attendees can participate and socialize together.

As you might expect from lawyers, the [Accessible Meetings Toolkit (pdf)](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/mental_physical_disability/Accessible_Meetings_Toolkit.authcheckdam.pdf) from the American Bar Association covers requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), but they are relevant everywhere.
