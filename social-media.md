# WIAD Social Media Channels
World IA Day is supported by the Information Architecture Institute (IAI). While we have a global team dedicated solely to our celebration, we collaborate with the IAI and they provide support in various ways such as social media promotion and mentions in the IA Institute Newsletter. This partnership helps us reach more people.

Each year, we select a new volunteer, called the Director of Social Media, to manage our social media channels and create a social media strategy. As part of their plan to promote World IA Day, youâ€™re invited to share your planning achievements, good IA articles and, of course, your community cheer. They can also help post opportunities for speakers, volunteers and sponsors. If you need help accessing your official World IA Day Twitter account, please review the Accessing Email, Twitter & Slack page of our guidebook.

We monitor the #WIAD and event hashtags #WIAD + YY (the last two digits of the year), i.e. #WIAD19 and you can always tag us @worldiaday on Twitter and on Facebook. Our Social Media Director works with the IAI Director of Communications to share your posts, where appropriate, with our audience through the following channels:
