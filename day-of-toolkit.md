# Celebration Day Toolkit
Every year we provide our locations with slides to give attendees a feel for what World IA Day is all about. This year we also included a couple new slides to send a friendly invitation to celebrate with us again next year. We understand each locationâ€™s program agenda will vary. We trust that you will incorporate these slides however it makes sense for your celebration.
