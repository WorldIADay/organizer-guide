# Finding Sponsors for Your Celebration

By now you should know the targeted size of your celebration and have the first draft of your budget complete. This is an important step, because without a budget to work towards it will be hard to communicate your needs to potential sponsors and secure financial or in-kind donations. Sponsors are more willing to give if they know exactly how their donation will help your celebration and what they can expect in return for their donation.

Asking for sponsorship will vary GREATLY in different countries. Please defer to your customs and business practices and share with us examples that work well in your location.

## Types of Sponsorship: In-Kind and Financial

Companies can help support your celebration by donating a product or service where the value is equal or close to the amount of the sponsorship levels you determine  -- this is called in-kind sponsorship. For example, providing the venue for your celebration is an in-kind sponsorship because the cost of renting the venue would be waived by the sponsor and the value is likely to equal a sponsorship level. Other examples are giveaways from the sponsor to your attendees, like books or pens.

A financial sponsorship, as the name indicates, is when a company or organization provides money toward your celebration. This is different from in-kind because no product or service is being provided; instead a monetary donation is being made.

> TIP: When asking for sponsorship you should clearly communicate what you will give the sponsor in return for their donation. For example, “We would love for our celebration to be held at [location] and in return we will promote your company with [X number of tweets, brand recognition, insert other local sponsor benefits here].’

## Finding Sponsors Leads

When we design a product or service, it is important to understand our target demographic. Sponsorship is no different. Whether you are looking for a donation from an educational institution, a small business, a large corporation or a government entity it is important to understand the needs of your target sponsors and what they value. We have provided some [personas](https://worldiaday.github.io/personas/) that you are free to use to get your team thinking about different types of sponsors.

> TIP: Remember, sponsorship is all about building relationships. People will appreciate the fact you took time to better understand their organization before approaching them for a donation.

Here are a few steps to help get you started:

### Make a list of organizations who will likely support our values and mission.
Many organizations have a desire to support initiatives that promote the betterment of society. It offers them a way to to get recognition for being good corporate citizens who support local community.
1. Start with your team and, as a group, identify organizations that you think might be willing to sponsor.
2. Once you have organizations identified, check out their websites and their social media accounts to learn more about how sponsorship might benefit them.
3. Determine who the decision maker might be and whether you know anyone who can make an introduction.
4. Review similar events and take note of who sponsored.

> TIP: Approach people personally, if possible. Individuals are far more likely to support our vision and be a champion within their organization. It also, provides an opportunity to develop good personal and business relationships with them in the future.

### Leverage existing relationships and attendee data.
If your location has hosted World IA Day in the past, leverage the relationships with previous sponsors and data from your location’s attendee list. Many times sponsors are willing to give again and they appreciate it when you ask them what you can do to improve their sponsorship experience.

Reach out to organizations whose employees attended last year. Use this data to help promote the success of your previous celebration and communicate how awesome your celebration will be this year too.

### Look for grants.
Some local governments or organizations offer grants to help support community activities and economic development. Look for these opportunities in your location.

## Ideas on Who to Approach

### Hiring Agencies
Hiring agencies love to sponsor events so they can find good talent. These are good partnerships because you can offer services like the ideas below. This way the sponsor receives brand recognition and the attendees receive valuable advice and the local city receives a monetary donation from the hiring agency.

A portfolio review to the first X # of people who sign up
* Panel from hiring agencies on how to interview and land a job
* Include visual or link examples where helpful
* Include sources if applicable

### Educational Institutions

Because the nature of our celebration is educational, institutions are often available to provide free or discounted spaces for the day, and are likely to have a range of sizes of space available.
- Partner with educational institutions who include IA and UX as part of their curriculum. Spend extra attention on looking into if any graduate programs in HCI, Library Science, Computer Science, Digital Media, Graphic Design and similar fields exist in your area.
- Set aside a specific number of tickets for them.
- Consider professors or instructors to speak or panel.
- Inquire whether the venue has materials that you can reuse like whiteboards or chalkboards for sketching/designing, tables and chairs, etc.
- Offers students professional networking and learning.
- Allows art school to be seen as a leader in IA space.
- Partner with educational institutions who include IA and UX as part of their curriculum.
- Spend extra attention on looking into if any graduate programs in HCI, Library Science, Computer Science, Digital Media, Graphic Design and similar fields exist in your area.

### Government and City Resources

*Tourism Offices*
Approach your local tourism office and see if they would be willing to organize and cover the hotel expenses of your out of town speakers.

*Hack-a-thons*
Lately, city hackathons have become increasingly popular. Look at the your city’s governmental website and try to find a Departments or Resources page. Research what companies sponsored the Hackathon and consider who on your team has an existing relationship. Typically, many companies will sponsor these kinds of events, so be diligent and research what company is a good fit for WIAD.

As an example, here a link to a story written by the City of Atlanta about a recent ‘govathon’:
http://www.atlantaga.gov/index.aspx?recordid=2000&page=672

A city’s Chamber of Commerce could also be a valuable resource. Look at your city’s Chamber of Commerce site and see if they have any articles or news about technology-related events or initiatives.
Consider your local library, or other government funded public spaces, to host.
Some cities that have not traditionally been thought of as ‘startup hubs’ have made great efforts to become incubators of startup activity. Try looking at your city website and seeing if any partnerships exist between a city and an organization dedicated to encouraging start-up activities. Start-ups can be great sponsors as they are trying to build strong local relationships. This is an example of something that might exist in your city: http://atlantatechvillage.com/

## Approaching and Securing Sponsorships

### Create a sponsorship strategy.
Identify your sponsor donation levels and what you will provide in return for each level. Consider what may be important to the sponsor and be flexible in your approach, making it clear that you are open to ideas on how you can provide value for their donation or further their business goals.

> TIP: Check out examples of sponsorship donation levels in the Location Examples folder in the Resource section of our guidebook.

Here are a few more things to consider:
1. Brand visibility is a way for organizations to get their name out to the community and has the potential to increase sales and attract new talent. Companies may want to see their logo everywhere from t-shirts to marketing collateral. Be specific on what level of sponsorship will provide such recognition and how you will promote their brand.
2. Be clear on how you will recognize them for their generosity before, during, and after the celebration. Based on their level of sponsorship, invite them to review materials that will include their logo or where they will be acknowledged (press releases, announcements, etc.).
3. Be willing to track and provide metrics to help evaluate the exposure the sponsor received throughout the campaign. Keeping the lines of communication open is important. Even if the numbers are not eye-popping the ability to show that you delivered what you promised is impactful. Building good sponsor relationships based on honesty and trust is essential and will make it more likely to get them on board next year.

> TIP: Tag us on Twitter [@WorldIADay](https://twitter.com/WorldIADay) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WorldInformationArchitectureDay/) and we will share your posts with our network as well. We love to help promote our generous sponsors from around the world.

Determine who on the team will reach out to each sponsor to avoid duplicate inquiries. You should also establish a plan to follow up with sponsors. Most of the time, 8 days is appropriate. Consider following up with a phone call to make a more human connection.

It’s wise to plan out what you will say before approaching a sponsor. Create a script that expresses a passion for IA, its value, and why sponsoring World IA Day would benefit them and the community (keep personas and your research in mind).

## Launch your campaign.
Finalize your sponsor prospectus and get ready to reach out to your target list. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Be judicious about how many companies you are approaching and keep your team updated. This is important so that you can determine whether you need to make modifications to your strategy and be sure your team knows what is going on with your campaign.
2. Call the sponsor contact and let them know how excited you are about celebrating World IA Day in your location. Mention how their organization could benefit by becoming a sponsor. Ask them about their business goals and tell them you would like to send them the sponsorship prospectus.
3. Write a personal email leveraging the script you created as part of your sponsorship strategy. Ask for feedback about which level interests them the most. Communicate a date that you would like to hear from them (perhaps 1 week, but this is up to you). Consider offering a discount if they make their donation before a specific date.
4. Don’t forget to attach the sponsor prospectus you created for your location.

## Close the deal.
Sponsorship is a business arrangement. It is important to have an agreement in writing so that both parties understand what to expect and are clear on what will be delivered. We have provided a [sponsorship agreement (Google Doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sLRu-6qQ8ayuO58EVBRcrQEpnpy6aAMmOuZqDNEa5KA/edit?usp=sharing) and [sponsorship invoice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vyTt7ob5eDKWHPVeeJGFl1YZOycsyEn-b9jo-3iTMSQ/edit?usp=sharing) templates for you to get started.

Here are a few steps we recommended as you secure sponsors:

1. Work closely with your budget and money raised so there is a continual balancing of how much you can spend. Decide on essential costs first, then add other items if it makes sense.
2. Remember to communicate, follow-up, and act professional. You gain credibility by doing what you say you will do which is an important aspect of relationship building. Provide them with information on time and arrive early to appointments.
3. Have a follow-up plan ready for sponsors who do commit. Once you get the agreement signed,
  - Collect a high-resolution logo from the sponsor to use for promotion.
  - Request the URL(s) of company site(s). The sponsor logo on your World IA Day location page will link to this url and the url may also be displayed on the slides for your celebration.
  - Collect a brief 3 sentence statement about the company's products or services. The statement can be used to acknowledge the sponsor at your celebration.
  - Ask the company if they would like to provide marketing materials or give-a-ways for distribution to WIAD attendees.
  - Collect handles for the company’s social channels. Additionally, ask if the sponsor would like to provide pre-written Tweets and/or allow your team to come up with them.
  - Depending on the size of your celebration, offer complimentary tickets and a sponsor table at your World IA Day celebration. If your celebration is more intimate, offer some other perks to make their experience pleasant. Ask that they provide the attendee name(s) for the Sponsor passes. If food is provided, consider offering sponsors a free meal.
4. Be sure to thank them for their donation and keep the lines of communication open. The goal is to build strong relationships so they will consider sponsoring annually.

> TIP: Be sure to communicate that sponsor attendees must register and perhaps provide a special name badge acknowledging them as a sponsor.

## Accepting money from your sponsors
Many sponsors will not make a donation to an individual person. If you do not have a way to accept money from your local sponsor, the IA Institute can help. We offer two ways for sponsors to donate funds to your location. The sponsor can: 1) submit a donation through PayPal or 2) mail a check to the IA Institute.
Below we provide instructions for both of these options.

> NOTE: The IA Institute DOES NOT cover fees incurred for donations (Paypal, Wire transfer fees, etc.) so you may want to ensure your donations cover these costs. We pay out incoming donations on the 15th and 30th of each month. We will keep an accounting ledger that will be available to you as we process transactions on your location’s behalf. If you have a time sensitive situation which requires you to receive the donation sooner, please contact treasury@iainstitute.org.

### Submit a donation using Paypal.

Send the following instructions to your sponsor:

1. Login to your (sponsor) PayPal account.
2. Go to Tools > Send money then select ‘Pay for goods or services’.
3. Enter `payments@iainstitute.org` as the email address and click ‘next’.
4. Enter the amount and the currency. Then in the field entitled ‘Enter special instructions to seller’, enter WIAD + Year + [ location name ].

  > Note: It is extremely important to note the location that will receive the donation. Please do not leave the note field blank.. **

5. Select the payment source and click ‘Send Money’.


### Submit a donation by mail.
We will accept checks made out to the IA Institute. Once deposited, the donation will be marked for the intended location if this information is clear (see the next section about receiving money) Send the following instructions to your sponsor:

1. Mail check to:
Information Architecture Institute
PO Box 9095
Tampa, FL 33647

2. In the memo section, note the location receiving the money (e.g. WIAD + `locationname`).

3. Ask your sponsor to provide you with the check number if possible.

> NOTE: This is a very important step. In the past, one company has sponsored multiple locations. If we do not have detailed information on where to send the donation, it may impact the amount of time it takes for you to receive your money.
