# WIAD Privacy Policy
World IA Day (“WIAD”) and the Information Architecture Institute ("the Institute") believe in protecting personal information whenever necessary. WIAD and the Institute also aim to connect our network of people together for the benefit of all and strives to do so while respecting personal privacy and confidential information.

WIAD and the Institute collect personally identifiable information for a number of reasons, including but not limited to membership, volunteer recruitment, and general correspondence. When this voluntary information is provided, it should be assumed that:
- Membership information may be shared with other members
- Volunteer information may be shared with other volunteers

All information may be reviewed by the WIAD Global Team, the Institute's Board of Directors and Leadership Council
Participation in surveys is voluntary, and the information received will not be shared in any way that could identify the participants.

WIAD and the Institute do not sell or share personally identifiable information in any way that is not covered in this policy. This includes information collected from attendees of our WIAD celebrations. 

If there is a change to this policy that will affect how we handle personal information, the affected individuals will be notified via email.
