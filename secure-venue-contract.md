## Venue Contract
Depending on the size of your celebration, you may want to consider having a contract drawn up to manage expectations between both parties and to ensure the space is reserved for you on the day of your celebration. Some important deals to work out with the venue in advance:

  - Point of contact
    - Provides access when needed
    - Schedules walk-through with vendors
    - Provides floorplans
    - Emergency or backup contact
  - Setup / breakdown responsibilities
    - A/V
    - Seating and tables
    - Cleaning responsibilities
      - Tables
      - Trash
      - Recycling
  - Venue Insurance
    - Talk to the venue to find out if insurance is required.
      - If you are required to carry venue insurance, the IA Institute may be able to help. Our insurance policy covers events located in Canada, the United States and Puerto Rico. If your celebration will happen in one of these locations, complete our [venue insurance request form](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzyzUdfMgDjmMnMzMkZOY1BPVmc). Then email it to treasury@iainstitute.org. We will submit the completed form on your location's behalf and provide the insurance certificate once received.
