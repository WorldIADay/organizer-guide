# Social Media Guide
At the global level, we have found Twitter to be the most efficient way to spread the word about events, as our community seems to be most active there. This document focuses mainly on Twitter for this reason.

Any social media channel, of course, can help you get the word out and we encourage you to promote your celebration wherever you think your target audience may be “gathering” online. We also encourage you to engage with other locations. Our community is very welcoming and supportive; many friendships have been forged this way.

The more traffic we generate, the more awareness we build, the more sponsors we get, the more locations we can host, the more we can all teach, learn, share knowledge and shape the future of information architecture.

## Collective Goals to Consider When Promoting

### BRING AWARENESS TO INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
- Our target audience includes individuals, companies and organizations within and outside of the IA discipline.
- Create interest to bring awareness to and encourage more people to attend our celebration.
- Help people understand the value of IA - information architecture as a discipline and area of expertise companies can leverage to help better communicate with their customers and employees, as well as understand and find information within various environments.
- Create continuity between the Information Architecture Institute (IAI) and World IA Day to raise awareness that our celebration is an IAI event.
- Leverage the IAI community to create more conversations.
- Inspire people to host a celebration the following year or join an existing team in their community.

### REPRESENT WORLD IA DAY AS A KIND AND WELCOMING COMMUNITY
- Make your event accessible to everyone (this includes your content).
- Showcase the progress made by ideas developed in previous celebrations.
- Promote sponsors by communicating their service or product value and extending the reach of their brand.
- Share thought provoking IA content.
- Display gratitude toward speakers.
- Communicate appreciation to volunteers.

## Our expectations
- Locations should support each other by:
  - Liking and following other locations
  - Retweeting posts from other locations
  - Creating dialog between locations to start a conversation
- To ensure our content is findable, we ask that you use specific hashtags when posting to social media. Hashtags include:
  - #WIADLocation   (example: #WIADTampa)
  - #WIADYY   (example: #WIAD18)
  - #WIAD
  - #IA
- Because World IA Day is an event supported by the Information Architecture Institute try to occasionally include us in your tweets and mentions. We would for love you to follow us too!
  - Official handle for World IA Day: @worldiaday
  - Official handle for IA Institute: @iainstitute
  - Official hashtags: #IAI, #IAInstitute

## Promotion through Twitter
This section includes guidance on value, tone and gives pre-written examples you are free to make your own.

### Tips to Increase Traffic and Engagement
- Mention influencers that have large networks ensuring the content is valuable.
Reply to people who respond to a post to encourage continued conversation and make them feel like part of the community.
- Engage or partner with local meetups to attract attendees from related disciplines such as user experience designers, content strategists, developers, business analysts, project managers, etc. Be sure to engage with entrepreneurial and maker communities too.
Identify key opinion leaders in IA, UX, in your location and try to engage with them to get involved with World IA Day so they retweet or mention your post.

## Some Tips on Accessibility
Helping people keep track of what happens before, during, and after a celebration makes it easier for everyone to take part, to enjoy and be inspired by it.

As the Social Media Director for World IA Day 2016, [José René Gutiérrez Álvarez](https://cr.linkedin.com/in/josernitos) ([@josernitos](https://twitter.com/@josernitos)) created a great article for live-posting during a celebration. You can [access it on Rosenfeld Media’s website](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/a-web-for-everyone/social-media-tips/).


## Sample Tweets
Consider scheduling social posts as the venue, sponsors and speakers are secured, weekly from December through early February, and daily the week of the celebration. We have included samples below that you can repurpose for your location.
