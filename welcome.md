## Frequently Asked Questions
Please see our FAQ on the WorldIADay.org Call for Locations page for answer to many of your questions. A few more are covered here:

### IA Is Not Well Understood In My Community. How Do I Explain It?
In the Resources section of our guidebook, we have included a short article written by Abby Covert. We find her language to be helpful when explaining Information Architecture to people with varying levels of familiarity with the discipline.

### How Does The Global Theme Work?
Each year we ask location organizers to submit theme ideas and then the Global team collectively votes on submissions to select our annual theme. The theme serves as a common thread to connect all of our locations and should be weaved into the content of your celebration.

The process for selecting the global theme is two-part:
1. The organizers will get a chance to submit theme suggestions
2. Suggestions are then analyzed and consulted with WIAD advisors.

If needed, we'll have a vote. Regardless, the global theme is announced by the end of August at the very latest.

### What Happens If I Am Selected As A Location Organizer And I’d Like To Pass The Role To Someone Else?
We do allow transfers of location representation. You will have the option to nominate someone who you heavily endorse to take over your role (they will have to complete a modified application). Otherwise, your celebration will be no longer be promoted as a participating location.
