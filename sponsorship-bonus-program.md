# Sponsorship Bonus Program
Many of you have great connections around the world with various influential companies. We have also noticed, over the years, an increased interest from sponsors contacted by location organizers requesting information about global sponsorship opportunities.

In the interest of cultivating more relationships with sponsors at the global level, we are asking for your help to connect with large-level donors while still retaining sponsorship for your location.

## Why a sponsorship bonus program?

We hope this is an exciting opportunity for everyone at every level of our celebration. Financial donations brought in at the global level help with accessibility needs and other emergency funding situations. If we are able to reach our funding goals this year ($75,000 USD) these donations will also contribute to our larger objectives, including:


Grants allocated to each location to assist with printing of promotional fliers, banners, and other documentation.
Food and beverage budgets for all locations.
Updates and improvements to the World IA Day website
Additional content archival support, which includes a new feature on the World IA Day website to easily upload archived materials to your location page.


## How does the bonus program work?

The finderâ€™s fee model is similar to what some companies have for employees that help find new hires: if you, as a location organizer, connect us directly with a major sponsor and we are able to obtain a global sponsorship (over $3000 USD), we will return **20% of the donation to your location to help fund your celebration.**

For example, if you were to put us in contact with an influential employee at Google, and they donate $5000 USD, global will receive the full amount from the sponsor and send a check or PayPal payment for $1000 USD (20%) to your location as a thank you for helping us secure a financial donation.

## How do I connect you to potential sponsors?

If you are in touch with a local sponsor that is interested in contributing at the global level, or have a connection at a company that you think would be interested in sponsoring, put them in touch with us at: sponsorship@worldiaday.org. We will discuss sponsorship opportunities with them and keep you updated on our progress.

Our global sponsorship prospectus will be provided, when available, in the Resource section of our guidebook. We encourage you to share it when reaching out to potential global sponsors.

## What is the timeline?

We secure all of our sponsorships before **December 30**, to ensure we are able to distribute funding to locations in time for their celebrations. Please get us in contact with potential global sponsors as soon as possible so we can cultivate the relationship prior to the end of 2016. Having time to build relationships is important as it can help secure financial support in subsequent years.

## Who is a good potential global sponsor?

We have existing sponsors from previous years and target sponsors that we are already in conversations with. Please do not contact the following sponsors directly for local or global sponsorship:

The best companies to target for global sponsorship are international, have a need to advertise their brand or job openings to our community, and have offices in multiple WIAD locations. Feel free to reach out to, or put us in touch with, your personal contacts at any company that you feel would be a good fit. Below we list companies that we believe would be ideal sponsors, but we are open to any company you think might be a good fit with the mission of our organization.
