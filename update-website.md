# Promoting via the WIAD Website

Website (worldiaday.org)
Our website is promoted as the go-to resource to find information about all of our celebrations around the world.

Participating World IA Day locations have a dedicated location and corresponding event page on our website to provide information about their celebration. We ask that you keep your event page up-to-date leading up to your celebration and be sure to provide links to content after it concludes. This is very important to us because it helps our celebration in the following ways:

**It provides a historical reference for your location.**
Starting in 2018, each year we add a new layer of events to each location so that information from past celebrations can still be viewed (ie worldiaday.org/events/{location}/{year}). Keeping your event pages up-to-date helps us capture the history of your celebration from year to year. It can also serve as a good historical reference should a new organizer host a celebration in your location in subsequent years.

**It helps us provide value to our global sponsors.**
Each year we are responsible for reporting performance metrics to our global sponsors. The ability to provide valuable information to our sponsors will increase the probability of support in the following year. The more people come to your location’s page, the more brand exposure our sponsors get; which is a very good thing.

**It helps people find information about your celebration.**
Each year we connect volunteers, sponsors, and attendees to locations through our website. Our website is one of the best resources to market your celebration to the world. We provide links to your registration page, live-stream feed, and more.

Over the years, various global teams have begun work to model the WIAD website to be more flexible and scalable. It was not until 2018, with the funding and support from The Understanding Group, LA DIA Design and various volunteers, that we have been able to completely re-architect the World IA Day website to reflect best practices and good principles of information architecture and design thinking.

The underlying structure of the WIAD is modeled through interviews with founding advisors, new and repeat local organizers in 2018, and subject matter experts in structured data and information architecture. It provides a foundational structure from which we can continue our work to expand and include the content archive and create a historical reference for years to come. More information about the WorldIADay.org redesign is planned to be documented at (https://worldiaday.github.io/website/)

## A Word About Our Website

Each World IA Day location has a dedicated page on our website. When we launch our website, each location page will have a basic description and organizers are responsible for updating and maintaining event page content. This document includes steps to guide you through accessing your event page, modifying page content, as well as a few recommendations around keeping your online presence accessible.

We are working towards establishing a strong brand for World IA Day. Based on results from a 2017 survey, we decided to keep our current brand intact and move forward with a strategy to create a more unified online presence. All locations should have an official email address and Twitter account this year. We ask that these accounts be utilized and to consider our Brand Guidelines when creating relevant content for your celebration.

We ask that you review our [WIAD Guidelines](guidelines.md) and follow them when creating your event page, as well as any other online presence used to provide information about your celebration. It is important that the World IA Day brand is represented consistently so that we can continue to attract new and provide value to existing sponsors who help make our event possible.  

We still have plans to improve the site further and feel we are off to a great start. From our guidebook to content archiving, we have a plan to move towards a solution that will better serve our organization as a whole. Check out the [WIAD Development Roadmap](https://github.com/WorldIADay/website/projects/1)

## Keep Accessibility In Mind

Our location pages are built to support compliance with standards for website accessibility. For example, when adding a photograph or an image, an alt tag will be required. We are working towards achieving the [WCAG 2.0, Level AA compliance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) because we believe everyone should have the ability to access our content.

If you decide to build a local website in addition to your location page, we would be delighted if you worked towards the same goal. There are a lot of sites and tools to guide you, but you can start with the [resources provided online](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/category/a-web-for-everyone/) by our Director of Accessibility for World IA Day, [Whitney Quesenbery](https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitneyq).

Her advice is to ‘_mostly, make it a well-written, usable page and structure the content with correct markup, and everything will fall into place._’ She also suggests a few tips to watch for:
- **Markup helps assistive technology navigate a page.** That means using lists for lists, headings for headings, and write meaningful text for links.
- **Identify images with “alt text”.** For people who can’t see images, assistive technology like screen readers look for “alternative text” that describes the image. Photos or images added to your location page will require text to be entered. Be sure to include names, repeat any words that are in the image, and give a very short description of what is happening in the picture, if applicable, or what the image is on the page to communicate.

Whitney also recommends the following resources:

### Tools to check website accessibility

####COLOR CONTRAST CHECKERS
These tools let you check whether a foreground and background color combination meets accessibility guidelines. The three here also help you adjust or create the color palette for good contrast.
- [Tanaguru color contrast checker](http://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com/) lets you lighten or darken the colors until you find an accessible solution.
- [Snook’s Colour Contrast Check](http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=33FF33,bg=333333) also lets you experiment to find a good color combination.
- [Color Safe](http://colorsafe.co/) is a designer’s tool, creating whole accessible color palettes.

#### WRITING ALTERNATIVE TEXT FOR IMAGES
- [Text alternatives for images: a decision tree](http://www.4syllables.com.au/2010/12/text-alternatives-decision-tree/) – a simple diagram from Dey Alexander, 4Syllables.
- [Writing great alt text](http://www.slideshare.net/whitneyq/writing-great-alt-text-61826426) – Whitney’s slides.

#### ACCESSIBLE TABLES AND FORMS
- [Creating accessible forms](http://webaim.org/techniques/forms/controls) – WebAim. Code samples and simple explanations.
- [Creating accessible tables](http://webaim.org/techniques/tables/data) – WebAim. More code samples and simple explanations.

#### Accessibility checkers

These free checkers will analyze web pages for problems and help you fix them. They also work on your content.
- [AXE – The Accessibility Engine](http://www.deque.com/products/aXe/) – from Deque has browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox that will analyze the current page.
- [WAVE from WebAIM](http://webaim.org/blog/wave-updates/) has an online version and a Chrome extension.
- [GrackleTalks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grackle-talks/ojlgifagodaoojkjjmmhmhklgkcmbgbk) checks the accessibility of content in GoogleDocs.

And, the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative has a long list of [more evaluation tools](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/).
